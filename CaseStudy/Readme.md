# Worker Absence Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict whether a worker will be absent from work using logistic regression. 

## Approach
1. Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values through imputation.
- Standardizing numerical features for consistent scaling.
- Encoding categorical variables (one-hot encoding).

2. Feature Engineering
Generating new features (e.g., total hours worked, absence patterns over time).
Selecting the most relevant features using statistical methods or model-based techniques.

3. Model Selection
Implemented Logistic Regression for binary classification (absent or not).
Evaluated alternative models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests) for comparison.

4. Model Evaluation
Accuracy: Percentage of correct predictions.
Precision & Recall: To balance false positives and false negatives.
